            <h2>Olivia Hurd</h2>
            <p>
                <br/> Olivia Hurd is originally from Stow, MA, a small suburb of Boston. Her home-away-from-home is her family’s
                cottage in Raymond, Maine, where she spends every summer. Her close-knit hometown, her lakehouse, and the
                greater Boston area, each holds a special place in her heart. A strong sense of family was ingrained in her
                upbringing, and she brings this core value to her associations with Bernstein &amp; Co. Olivia has an older
                sister, who also attended UVM, and a younger brother who is a junior in high school. She is pursuing a B.S.
                in mathematics and data science at the University of Vermont. Outside the classroom, she is a member of the
                university’s field hockey team. She enjoys spending time with her friends and family, being outdoors, travelling,
                and, of course, exploring new places to eat in and around Burlington. Her favorite spots on campus are Henderson’s
                cafe, secluded niches in the library, and the top floor of Williams, where there is a beautiful view of Burlington
                and Lake Champlain.

            <h2>Maria Kissel</h2>
            <p>
                <br/> Maria Kissel was born on April 8, 1998 in Queens, New York; however, she has spent most of her life in Pennsylvania.
                Throughout her life, Maria has been able to travel growing her appreciation for different cultures. She has
                been to the Caribbean, Europe, Russia, and various parts of North America. Through travel, her need for adventure
                has skyrocketed. In her freetime she enjoys snowboarding, hiking, and trying new things. The landscape surrounding
                the University of Vermont had her absolutely in awe... that and the farm-to-table food motto. Upon deciding
                she wanted to be a Computer Science major, she found herself in Lisa Dion's Into to Website Development class
                where she discovered her love of CSS. Her reputation with CSS has now put the pressure in designing a sleek
                final project. With CSS, Maria has been able to utilize her sense of color combination to make websites look
                good. Now, she has the pleasure on tackling the CSS for Bernstein &amp; Co. She hopes you enjoy all the time
                and effort the CSS took.
